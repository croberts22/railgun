Railgun is an extension to the [MyAnimeList API](http://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api). 

## Motivation

Previously, a separate project dedicated to providing a richer developer experience was derived from [chuyeow](https://github.com/chuyeow)'s fantastic [myanimelist-api](https://github.com/chuyeow/myanimelist-api). It seems like that project is no longer in development, nor does it seem like there is any interest in reviving the endpoints. So, I've decided to take in the responsibility of creating my own so that people can harness a stronger, dedicated API. Furthermore, MyAnimeList's official API hasn't been updated in several years, stagnating development.

Learning a few new languages and technologies is also a New Year's Resolution of mine. I'm not familiar with Ruby and Sinatra, so I've decided to dedicate this project for my own learning's sake.

## Requirements

- A User-Agent from MyAnimeList.net
- Ruby 2.0.0 or greater

## How to Use

Coming soon.

## Why the name "Railgun"?

A few reasons:

- Railguns are blazingly fast, efficient, and powerful. Those are the principles for what this API will accomplish.

- It's the nickname given to [Misaka Mikoto](http://myanimelist.net/character/13701/Mikoto_Misaka) from [A Certain Scientific Railgun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6213/Toaru_Kagaku_no_Railgun).

- It just sounds badass.
